## Introduction

**sanger-tol/busco** is a bioinformatics pipeline to run BUSCO across _many_ genomes and _many_ lineages.

It simply iterates over all requested combinations of genomes and lineages and run BUSCO.

> [!WARNING]
> This pipeline is still in development. Documentation is still missing.
> To run the pipeline, refer to the test profile and adjust to your own data.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run sanger-tol/busco \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

## Credits

sanger-tol/busco was originally written by Tyler Chafin during the
[Cambridge BioHackathon 2024](https://www.c2d3.cam.ac.uk/events/2024-biohackathon)
with the participation of:

- [Pete Dockrill **@PeteDockrill**](https://github.com/PeteDockrill)
- [Axel Rodriguez **@errepeAxel**](https://github.com/errepeAxel)

[Matthieu Muffato **@muffato**](https://github.com/muffato) then
updated the pipeline for release under the [sanger-tol](https://github.com/sanger-tol)
umbrella organisation.

The pipeline underwent a large reset in v0.2.0 to focus on automating
BUSCO runs.
Functionality to run the BUSCO steps has been removed but will be reintegrated later.
